ENVIRONMENT SETUP - Setup decisioning services, validate whether decisioning services are running

APPLICATION CREATION -- created the application - Artifacts, NBAD Tests, ops manager rulesets, XCAR, CAR Model , NBAD Template, Context dictionary

BUSINESS TAXONOMY, - Issues, groups, propositions, attributes , GENERATED FORM, CUSTOM FORM, versioned proposition data / unversioned propositioned data.

STRATEGY -- SIMPLe strategy components, canvas, run the strategy.


==========================================


CHURN -- Customer lost

for ex -- netflix has 500 customers in jan 2024, netflix is having only 300 customers in may 2024

-- 200 customers are churn

200/500 * 100 ==

===========================================================================

CLV -- Customer Lifetime Value

--- Net profit score as part of customer's lifetime relationship with business

--- for ex -- you are using airtel mobile connection since last 5 years
your friend using the same airtel recently since last 6 months


ur CLV value will be higher compared to CLV of ur friend

=====================================================================

Propensity --- which is how likely the customer responds positively to an action/proposition

propensity is calculated for each action/proposition using ADAPTIVE MODELS / PREDICTIVE MODELS.

0 - 1 

0 - BEING LOWEST PROPENSITY

1- BEING HIGHEST PROPENSITY ==== .pyPropensity

0.56 == 56% probability is there customer will accept the offer
proposition of MASTERCARD -- 0.95 == 95% probability is there customer will accept that offer/prosition/action
0.6554

0.5 PROPENSITY FOR ALL PROPOSITIONS AT INITIAL STAGE == 50% PROBABILITY

AS customers keep accepting the offers

u promoted credit card to 100 customers... 80 ppl accept ======== propensity will keep increasing

0.51, 0.52,0.524,...............

as customers reject credit card --------- propensity wil keep decreasing

0.5000, 0.491,0.489...........


1 million, 10 million customers ---- 

1million times ==== which can give bad performance

--- after how many responses we shud calculate propensity ==== 1000 , 5000 responses

u sent 1CRPersonal loan offer to 1 millions customers -- 1 person responded as rejected, till 1000 responses adaptive model wont trigger... 

====== EVIDENCE -- PYEVIDENCE ====== number of responses after which model should recalculate the propensity.


========================================================

NETPROMOTERSCORE ---- Net promoter score is how satisfied a customer is with the business products/services

for ex -- u have used zomato and u are very much satisfied and u have rated it 5 star on playstore

u wil also promote the app to ur friends...

.NetPromoterScore of customer 1== high

.netpromoterscore of customer 2 == low

-1 to +1
======

-1 0.5
-0.66

+psotive netpromoter score == happiest customers

ur netpromoterscore will be highe compared to others who gave a poor rating.
