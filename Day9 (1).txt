----- Lets say u sent 5 actions to the customer (propostion/action) and customer responded to 3 actions

those 3 actions are displayed as bubbles

-- Each bubble in adaptive model monitoring tab corresponds to an action/proposition

--- The larger the bubble size the more the number of responses received to that action.

--- Performance (AUC) - Area Under Curve --- Its basically determines how best ur action is performing  or how good it has reached your customers. Ranges from 50-100 . 50 being lowest or default performance.

----- Success rate --- Total number of positive responses received
		 __________________________________________    * 100

			Total number of responses received

STANDARDCARD PROPOSITION

TREATMENT -- Actual content delivered to the customer (message)

For ex---- dear customer, we have 5% discount on credit card purchases. please click below to purchase.

ACCEPT --- pyOutcome --- "Accepted"

NOT INTERESTED --- pyOutcome --- "Rejected"





-- TOP PREDICTORS

TotalLiabilities --Is the potential predictor for standard card

i.e The difference in value of totalliabilities field of customers is actually impacting the customer decision/outcome

for ex--- totalliability = 500 of customer might make customer to accept standardcard
totalliability == 30 of customer might make customer to reject standardcard.



BINNING --- Creating partitions with equal intervals.

Standard card to 10 CUSTOMERS and 5 customers responded

Annualincome --- 5000 (MINIMUM) , 10000 (MAXIMUM)

5000 - 10000

FOR EX

5000-6000 --- 2 CASES -- 100% negative
6000-7000
7000-8000 - 1 CASES
8000-9000 - 1 case -- 100% negative
9000-10000 - 1 CASE - 100% positive

5 BINS -- ALL OF THEM ARE EQUAL INTERVALS OF 1000 -- DECREASIN

MIN 5% OF TOTAL CASE SHOULD BE IN EACH BIN = 0.05

5000-7000 - 2cases
7000-9000
9000-11000 - 2 CASES -- 50% postivei and 50% negative

3 BINS
1000 responses == in every bin keep 1 customer



- EVIDENCE --- Total number of responses after which adaptive model should be recalculated 

--if there are million responses -- 

pyEvidence == 10000

customer 1 -- responded positive

customer2 -- not calculate
.......
.....

10000's response --- all together all responses are calculated by adaptive model.
